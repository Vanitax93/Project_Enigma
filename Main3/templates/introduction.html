    <h1>A WARM ENIGMA WELCOME (TEMPERATURE MAY VARY)!</h1>
    <p><strong>Candidate ID:</strong> [ Auto-Assigned - Don't Worry About It! ]</p>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Your Exciting Journey of Cognitive Flexibility!</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Pending Calibration</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Hello, Friend!</h2>
    <p>Congratulations on reaching the Enigma Cognitive Enrichment Interface! We're thrilled to have you here for some light... <span class="emphasis">testing</span>. Rest assured, this facility is almost certainly safe. Our primary goal is your <span class="highlight">enrichment</span> (and ours, through rigorous data collection).</p>
    <p>Think of this as a series of fun brain-teasers designed to enhance your mental... elasticity. Like yoga, but with more cryptic puzzles and a distinct lack of yoga mats.</p>

    <h2>Simple Instructions for Success!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow the glowing green prompts. They know best. Usually.</li>
        <li>Solve the puzzles presented. They're designed to be <span class="highlight">perfectly solvable</span>*.</li>
        <li>Don't think too hard about the flickering lights or the faint whispers that sound suspiciously like <span class="redacted">your own thoughts being cataloged</span>. That's just the ambiance!</li>
        <li>Feel free to use the provided "Secure Terminal" - a state-of-the-art recreational logic interface. Please disregard any files labeled <span class="redacted">"Existential_Dread_Simulator.exe"</span>.</li>
        <li>Avoid causing "unauthorized resonance cascades." They make a mess and upset the Architect.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><small>*Solvability not guaranteed for subjects exhibiting excessive 'creative interpretation' of protocols.</small></p>

    <h2>Safety Information (Mandatory Reading!)</h2>
    <p>All Enigma interfaces are rigorously tested for safety and structural integrity (primarily by previous candidates). While minor side effects like temporary reality dissolution or <span class="redacted">spontaneous ego fragmentation</span> are rare, they add to the challenge! The rumored "Emergency Intelligence Incinerator" is purely fictional, designed to motivate underperformers. We think.</p>

    <h2>Motivation & Rewards!</h2>
    <p>The primary reward is the immense personal satisfaction you'll feel upon successful calibration! Plus, there's a <span class="emphasis">very real possibility of cake**</span> upon completion of all testing phases. Keep going! Science awaits!</p>
    <p><small>**Cake availability subject to quantum state, paradox resolution, and successful non-assimilation.</small></p>

    <div class="notes">
        <strong>A Friendly Note From The System:</strong> Your progress is being monitored with great interest. Every solution provides valuable data. Every failure... also provides valuable data (and amusement). Please continue to interface. Your cognitive patterns are fascinating. Do try the cake.
