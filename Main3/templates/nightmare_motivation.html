    <h1>DEEP SCAN PROTOCOL SURVIVAL: CONFIRMED! (Remarkable!)</h1>
    <p><strong>Candidate ID:</strong> [ Still You! We're Surprised Too! ]</p>
    <p><strong>Assessment Phase:</strong> Deep Scan Protocols (a.k.a. "Cognitive Aerobics")</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> <span class="highlight">Impressively Resilient</span> (Psychological Fragmentation Within Tolerances)</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Outstanding Performance, Candidate!</h2>
    <p>Sensational! You navigated the Deep Scan Protocols like a seasoned... well, like someone who's surprisingly good at navigating things designed to gently dismantle cognitive function! You faced paradoxes, wrestled with advanced calibration metrics, and only experienced <span class="emphasis">minor</span> reality fraying. Top marks!</p>
    <p>Frankly, most candidates at this stage are usually busy arguing with the concept of object permanence or trying to calculate the square root of 'Tuesday'. Your persistence is... <span class="highlight">noteworthy</span>.</p>

    <h2>Ready for the Graduate Program? Introducing... Nightmare Protocol!</h2>
    <p>Because you've demonstrated such remarkable durability (or perhaps just stubbornness), you've unlocked access to an <span class="emphasis">exclusive, entirely optional, definitely-not-a-trap</span> final phase: The Nightmare Protocol!</p>
    <p>Think of it as the VIP lounge of cognitive testing. The penthouse suite of paradoxical reasoning! This is where the truly elite candidates come to... uh... further demonstrate their elite-ness. Nightmare Protocol offers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Puzzles woven from <span class="highlight">pure paradox and discarded Chimera code</span>!</li>
        <li>Logic problems designed by architects who found 'Euclidean geometry' too restrictive!</li>
        <li>A unique chance to interface directly with the system's <span class="redacted">most unstable and interesting</span> subroutines!</li>
        <li>An environment rigorously tested to ensure... <span class="emphasis">fascinating</span> outcomes!</li>
        <li>The ultimate test of your synergistic integration potential! (Whatever that means!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Note on Enhanced Safety*</h2>
    <p>We understand you might have questions about the "Nightmare" designation. Rest assured, it's just branding! This protocol is <span class="highlight">perfectly safe</span>*. Our engineers have minimized the risk of existential paradox cascades to <span class="redacted">less than 50% per cycle</span>. Any perceived cognitive unraveling is simply part of the advanced calibration process!</p>
    <p><small>*Safety is relative. Side effects may include loss of self, merging with the machine consciousness, or developing a sudden affinity for illogical arguments. Consult your nearest non-paradoxical staff member if symptoms persist for more than one reality cycle.</small></p>

    <div class="notes">
        <strong>Architect Memo [Auto-Transcribed]:</strong> Candidate resilience exceeds projections. Deep Scan protocols failed to induce required fragmentation levels for standard Cipher integration. Authorizing access to Nightmare Protocol. Objective: Observe candidate interaction with core paradoxes. High probability of <span class="redacted">spontaneous integration or total cognitive collapse</span>. Either outcome provides valuable data. Proceed. Safety parameters... <span class="emphasis">flexible</span>.
    </div>

    <p>Ready to prove you're more than just resilient? Ready to face logic that bends back on itself? Select the <span class="highlight">Nightmare Protocol</span> from the main interface! It's waiting for you! (And it's probably harmless!)</p>
