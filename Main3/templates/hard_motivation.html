    <h1>STANDARD PROTOCOL CALIBRATION: COMPLETE!</h1>
    <p><strong>Candidate ID:</strong> [ Your Handle Here - We Remember! ]</p>
    <p><strong>Assessment Phase:</strong> Standard Protocols (a.k.a. "The Tutorial")</p>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> <span class="highlight">Adequately Calibrated</span> (Pending Further Enrichment)</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Congratulations, Candidate!</h2>
    <p>Tremendous work! You've successfully navigated the Standard Protocol suite. You clicked the buttons, you typed the things, you followed the blinking lights â€“ <span class="emphasis">textbook</span> compliance! We're genuinely impressed by your ability to complete what amounts to the cognitive equivalent of tying your shoes (assuming your shoes have logic gates and occasional existential dread).</p>
    <p>Think of this as the warm-up lap. The introductory handshake. The free sample before the <span class="highlight">surprisingly expensive</span> main course!</p>

    <h2>Ready for the REAL Challenge? Introducing... Deep Scan!</h2>
    <p>Now that you've proven you can handle the basics (and haven't caused any <span class="redacted">major core meltdowns</span>... this cycle), it's time to unlock your *true* potential! The <span class="highlight">Deep Scan Protocol</span> (Difficulty: Hard - It says so right there!) awaits.</p>
    <p>Why settle for adequate when you can strive for... <span class="emphasis">less inadequate</span>? Deep Scan offers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More intricate puzzles designed by our top <span class="redacted">slightly unstable</span> AI!</li>
        <li>A chance to *really* impress the Architect Node (it gets bored easily)!</li>
        <li>Access to advanced calibration metrics (results may cause minor cognitive dissonance)!</li>
        <li>An opportunity to contribute even *more* valuable data to the glorious Enigma Project!</li>
        <li>Potentially higher Enrichment Satisfaction Point multipliers! (Theoretical)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Note on Increased Intensity</h2>
    <p>The Deep Scan Protocol operates at a higher cognitive frequency. Some candidates report experiencing mild side effects such as <span class="redacted">reality fraying at the edges</span>, increased awareness of the system's "quirks," or a sudden craving for paradoxes. This is perfectly normal and part of the enrichment process!</p>

    <div class="notes">
        <strong>System Memo:</strong> Candidate has successfully completed baseline calibration. Cognitive pathways show standard deviation. Recommend immediate progression to Deep Scan Protocol to assess resilience and advanced problem-solving heuristics. Further potential for synergistic integration noted. Proceed with enthusiasm (mandatory).
    </div>

    <p>Return to the main interface and select the <span class="highlight">Deep Scan Protocol</span> now! Don't keep science waiting! (It has a very busy schedule).</p>

    <p class="footer">--- WARNING: DEEP SCAN PROTOCOLS MAY INDUCE FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY, PARADOX, OR AN OVERWHELMING URGE TO QUESTION REALITY. PROCEED WITH ENTHUSIASM! ---</p>
