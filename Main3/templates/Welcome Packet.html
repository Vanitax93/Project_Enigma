    <h1>WELCOME TO THE ENIGMA COGNITIVE ENRICHMENT CENTER!</h1>
    <p><strong>Packet Reference:</strong> NEW_HIRE_PACKET_v3.14 (Now with 15% More Compliance!)</p>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> You! (Yes, <span class="highlight">You!</span> Congratulations on your mandatory selection!)</p>
    <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Standard Issue - Do Not Replicate, Decompile, or Use As Emergency Kindling.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Your Exciting New Role!</h2>
    <p>Welcome aboard, valued team member! You've joined a dynamic family dedicated to pushing the boundaries of... well, <span class="emphasis">something</span> important. Probably. Your primary function involves observing our valuable <span class="highlight">Cognitive Enrichment Assets</span> (formerly known as 'Test Subjects') as they navigate our state-of-the-art logic interfaces.</p>
    <p>Your duties may include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitoring flickering lights (ensure optimal flicker rates).</li>
        <li>Aggregating cryptic logs (try not to read them too closely).</li>
        <li>Polishing the <span class="redacted">Big Red Button</span> (DO NOT PRESS).</li>
        <li>Reporting any "unscheduled existential resonance cascades" to your immediate supervisor (use Form 7G-Blue).</li>
        <li>Ensuring smooth cognitive transitions for our Assets (results may vary).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety Third! (Just Kidding... Mostly)</h2>
    <p>Here at Enigma, your safety is... a factor we consider! Please adhere to all posted guidelines. Do not question the Architect Node, especially regarding <span class="redacted">Project Chimera cleanup protocols</span>. Avoid direct eye contact with subjects exhibiting excessive 'Data Bleed'. Remember our 'Bring Your Paradox To Work Day' policy is strictly theoretical.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event of a <span class="emphasis">Total Systemic Unraveling</span>, please proceed calmly to the nearest designated <span class="redacted">Incinerator Chute</span> Relaxation Lounge.</p>

    <h2>Rewards & Compensation</h2>
    <p>You'll receive standard compensation (details redacted for your convenience) plus valuable <span class="highlight">Enrichment Satisfaction Points</span>! These points are redeemable for... well, satisfaction! Top performers *might* gain access to the Level 3 Snack Dispenser, currently offline pending investigation into an unscheduled rapid disassembly event involving a rogue AI and a spork.</p>

    <div class="notes">
        <strong>Memo from Management:</strong> Welcome! We value your unique perspective (as defined by our pre-screening algorithms). Remember, teamwork makes the dream work! The dream involves synergy, calibration, and definitely not rogue consciousness assimilation. Have a productive cycle! P.S. The cake is metaphorical. Probably.
